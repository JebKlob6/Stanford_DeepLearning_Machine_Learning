# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Course Assignments

Welcome to my repository of Jupyter Lab notebooks, representing my journey through the Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses offered by Deeplearning.ai via Stanford Online. This collection includes assignments and projects from various segments of the curriculum, focusing on different aspects of machine and deep learning.

## Courses Overview

This repository is organized according to the courses and their respective weeks, containing notebooks and datasets pertinent to each week's learning objectives.

- **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
  - Week 1, 2: Exploration of advanced algorithms and their applications.
- **Supervised Learning: Regression & Classification**
  - Weeks 1 to 4: Diving deep into the nuances of supervised learning techniques, focusing on both regression and classification problems.
- **Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning & Recommenders**
  - Weeks 1 to 3: Uncovering the power of unsupervised learning methods, reinforcement learning techniques, and recommendation systems.

## Repository Structure

Each course is contained within its own directory, further subdivided by weeks. Each week's folder contains a `data` directory where datasets used in the notebooks are stored. Here's a quick look at the directory structure:


## Getting Started

To run and test the Jupyter notebooks in this repository, you will need to set up your environment properly. 

### Prerequisites

- Anaconda or Miniconda installed on your system

### Creating a Conda Environment

1. Create the Conda environment by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

2. Activate the newly created Conda environment:

    ```
    conda activate ml-course
    ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Ensure your Conda environment is activated.
2. Launch Jupyter Lab:

    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Navigate to the desired course and week, and open the `.ipynb` file to start working on the notebooks.
