# Machine Learning and Deep Learning Course Assignments

Welcome to my repository of course assignments from the Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses offered by Deeplearning.io through Stanford Online. This repository is structured to reflect my learning journey through various advanced algorithms, supervised learning techniques, and unsupervised learning methods. Here, you'll find Jupyter Notebooks filled with implementations, experiments, and my personal insights.

## Courses Overview

This repository is organized into three main sections, each representing a course segment:

1. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**
2. **Supervised Learning: Regression and Classification**
3. **Unsupervised Learning: Reinforcement and Recommenders**

Each course segment is further divided by weeks, with each week containing specific datasets used for assignments and explorations.

## Getting Started

To run and test the notebooks in this repository, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
